#+TITLE: helm-dired-open

Right-clicking a file in most GUI file managers provides an
"Open with" menu for choosing an application to be used. This package
implements such functionality for Emacs default file manager Dired.

** Installation

The package is not available on MELPA yet, please use Quelpa (or your
preferred package manager) to install.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package helm-dired-open
  :ensure t
  :quelpa (helm-dired-open
           :fetcher github
           :repo "FrostyX/helm-dired-open"
           :branch "master"))
#+END_SRC

Or if you are a developer.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package helm-dired-open
  :ensure t
  :quelpa (helm-dired-open
           :fetcher file
           :path "~/git/helm-dired-open"))
#+END_SRC

** Configuration

By default, the list of associated applications is searched in the
user-defined ~helm-dired-open-extensions~ variable and then in the XDG
database. The first source that returns non-nil value is used, the
rest is not evaluated. To add a custom source, disable some
predefined, or change their order, configure
~helm-dired-open-functions~.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq helm-dired-open-functions
      '(helm-dired-open-configured-applications
        helm-dired-open-xdg-applications))
#+END_SRC

*** Custom applications

The configuration schema was inspired by and tries to resemble the
~dired-open-extensions~ variable from ~dired-open~ (provided by
~dired-hacks~ package). See the following example.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq helm-dired-open-extensions
      (let ((images
             '(("eog" . "Open with image viewer")
               ("pinta" . "Edit in pinta")
               ("gimp" . "Edit in GIMP")))
            (video
             '(("vlc --one-instance" . "Play in VLC")
               ("vlc --one-instance --playlist-enqueue" . "Add to VLC queue"))))
            `(("png" . ,images)
              ("jpg" . ,images)
              ("mp4" . ,video)
              ("avi" . ,video))))
#+END_SRC

*** Custom applications with icons

One of the many options to make the list of applications a bit cooler.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(setq helm-dired-open-extensions
      (let ((images
             `(("eog" .
                ,(format "%s Open with image viewer" (fontawesome "image")))
               ("pinta" .
                ,(format "%s Edit in pinta" (fontawesome "edit")))
               ("gimp" .
                ,(format "%s Edit in GIMP" (fontawesome "edit")))))
            (video
             `(("vlc --one-instance" .
                ,(format "%s Play in VLC" (fontawesome "play")))
               ("vlc --one-instance --playlist-enqueue" .
                ,(format "%s Add to VLC queue" (fontawesome "list"))))))
        `(("png" . ,images)
          ("jpg" . ,images)
          ("mp4" . ,video)
          ("avi" . ,video))))
#+END_SRC
